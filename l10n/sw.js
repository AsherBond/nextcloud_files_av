If a file is identified as a virus, it is either logged or not uploaded to the server. The application relies on the underlying ClamAV virus scanning engine, which the admin points Nextcloud to when configuring the application. Alternatively, a Kaspersky Scan Engine can be configured, which has to run on a separate server.\nFor this app to be effective, the ClamAV virus definitions should be kept up to date. Also note that enabling this app will impact system performance as additional processing is required for every upload. More information is available in the Antivirus documentation." : "Antivirus kwa faili ni programu ya antivirus ya Nextcloud.\n\n* üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Mtumiaji anapopakia faili, inachaguliwa\n* ‚ò¢Ô∏è Faili zilizopakiwa na zilizoambukizwa zitafutwa na arifa itaonyeshwa na/au kutumwa kupitia barua pepe\n* üîé Kazi ya Chini ili kuchanganua faili zote\n* ‚ùì Tumia ClamAV (chanzo wazi), Injini ya Kuchanganua ya Kaspersky au skana inayoendana na ICAP\n\nProgramu hii hukagua faili ambazo zimepakiwa kwenye Nextcloud kwa virusi kabla ya kuandikwa kwenye hifadhi ya Nextcloud. Ikiwa faili itatambuliwa kama virusi, inaingia au haijapakiwa kwenye seva. Programu inategemea injini ya msingi ya kuchanganua virusi vya ClamAV, ambayo msimamizi anaelekeza Nextcloud wakati wa kusanidi programu. Vinginevyo, Injini ya Scan ya Kaspersky inaweza kusanidiwa, ambayo inapaswa kukimbia kwenye seva tofauti.\nIli programu hii ifanye kazi vizuri, ufafanuzi wa virusi vya ClamAV unapaswa kusasishwa. Pia kumbuka kuwa kuwezesha programu hii kutaathiri utendaji wa mfumo kwani uchakataji wa ziada unahitajika kwa kila upakiaji. Maelezo zaidi yanapatikana katika nyaraka za Antivirus.",
